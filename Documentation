installed ubuntu on a laptop via USB.

created zip_job.py using an online python IDE:
      create zip files with .txt files within based on a fixed array and an environment variable as a suffix. 
      
installed docker engine.
installed docker desktop.
created a Dockerfile based on ubuntu`s latest version. inside the image:
      installed vim, python, zip and unzip.
      copied zip_job.py to the image`s /tmp folder.
      added a CMD directive to print OS type and architecture + verify /tmp/zip_job.py exists.
run a container based on the image and tested functionality, as a root user to avoid any permission problems.
pushed the docker image into a public repository named "yaleea/final".

deployed a jenkins server using the docker image.
configured additional plugins to the jenkins server to support docker agents.
There were two problems:
1. Since the server ran via Docker, it wasn't able to run the build container in it (container inside a container) without some hacking.
2. Computer was too slow and could no connect in a stable manner.

And so I moved to a faster computer and installed everything again on a Kubuntu VM.
this time I deployed a jenkins server using the full ubuntu installation, instead of the Docker-based one.
Now I could run pipelines on the build image.

As part of the piplines I configured an SMTP connection from the jenkins server to my gmail account.

wrote a declarative pipeline:
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker { 
            image 'yaleea/final:latest' 
            args '--privileged'
            // label 'zip-job-docker'
            
        }
    }
    stages {
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'python3 /tmp/zip_job.py'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Report') {
            steps {
                emailext body: 'Hello ${currentBuild.currentResult}',
                subject: 'Work status',
                to: 'yalee1996@gmail.com'
            }
        }
    }
 
}


wrote a scriptive pipline:
node {
    docker.image('yaleea/final').inside('--privileged ') {
        AGENT_LABEL = 'zip-job-docker'
    stage('build') { 
        sh 'python3 /tmp/zip_job.py'
    }
    stage('Publish') { 
        def emailBody = 'Hello ${currentBuild.currentResult}'
        def emailSubject = "Work status"
        
         emailext body: "${emailBody}",
                subject: "${emailSubject}",
                to: 'yaleealmaliah@gmail.com'
    }
      stage('Cleanup') { 
       deleteDir()
    }
    
    }
